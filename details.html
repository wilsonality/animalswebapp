                <h2>What is an octopus?</h2>
                <p>The octopus is a an eight-armed marine animal. It is classified as a mollusc, sharing the phylum with snails and squids. The octopus is a predator with the ability to excrete ink, camouflage, and move quickly through water. All octopuses are venomous.</p>

            <p>The octopus has three hearts, two of which are active while swimming.
                Octopuses are tired easily from swimming, and move mostly by crawling.
                The arms of an octopus can move independently, and they can taste with their suction cups.
                However, they must keep their arms within sight because of their poor proprioception.
                Some octopuses do not have color vision.
            </p>
            <p>The giant Pacific octopus is the largest living octopus species.
                It weighs up to 110 lb and a wing/arm span of 16 ft.

                Fun Fact: the mythical Greek monster, the Gorgon, is inspired by the octopus.
