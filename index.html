                    The camouflage of a chameleon can be a social, defensive, or environmental reaction.
                    The chameleon is native to the continent of Africa, parts of the Middle East, and the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent.

                <p class="caption">Fun Fact: Chameleons are able to change their skin through subcutaneous pigments. The molecular mechanism that
                    allows chameleons to tune the wavelength given off by these pigments is still unknown to science.
